  *Each student should submit a separate assignment, even if it is an identical computer file to the rest of your study group. When submitting assignments, please include your name and the assignment number as part of the filename. Please write the names of your study group members at the beginning of your homework.*
  
  
  1. What are the names of the people in your study group?
  2. Write up the results of your work in Lab 8. Explain each step and your choices. Don't just upload a mass of output, make it clear and understandable about what's going on in the data. Explain some hypothesis tests. Impress me.
3. Each person in the group should find 2 more academic articles related to your current choice of final project. Write a short paragraph on each, concentrating on what data is used (and whether it is accessible), what econometric techniques, and what questions are addressed.
